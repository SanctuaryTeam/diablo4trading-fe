## Role-Based Authentication and Authorization

Authorization system that assigns roles to users and enforces permissions based on those roles.

### Backend Setup

Authentication, role assignment, and authorization checks.

### Database Schema

Create a database schema that stores user data along with the roles.

### Authentication

Implement user authentication using techniques like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based authentication. Upon successful authentication, the backend should provide a token containing user information, including their assigned roles.

### Authorization Middleware

Create middleware that can be used to check user roles and permissions for specific routes. 

### React Integration

Need to make requests to the backend to retrieve user role information and determine whether certain features or pages should be accessible.
